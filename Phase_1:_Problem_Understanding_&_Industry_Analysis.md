# CharityConnect CRM – Donor Transparency & Campaign Management System  

## Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis  

**Industry:** Non-Profit / Charity (Crowdfunding & Donations)  
**Project Type:** Salesforce CRM Implementation (Admin + Developer)  
**Target Users:** Donors, NGO Staff/Admins, Beneficiaries  

---

## Problem Statement  

Non-profit organizations often struggle to manage donations, campaigns, and donor trust due to:  
- Scattered records maintained in Excel/Google Sheets.  
- Lack of transparency on how donations are spent.  
- Difficulty in tracking donor engagement and recurring contributions.  
- Manual effort required to generate impact reports.  

This leads to donor mistrust, low engagement, and inefficiency in managing campaigns.  

---

## Goal  

Implement a Salesforce CRM that:  
- Centralizes donor, campaign, and beneficiary data.  
- Automates donation tracking, acknowledgements, and reminders.  
- Provides transparency by mapping donations → beneficiaries → impact reports.  
- Offers dashboards and reports for real-time NGO performance insights.

## Requirement Gathering  

### Business Needs  
- A single platform to manage donors, donations, campaigns, and beneficiaries.  
- Automated thank-you emails and donation receipts.  
- Transparency for donors to view exact impact of their contributions.  
- Dashboards for NGO staff to monitor fundraising performance.  

### Functional Requirements  
- **Donor Object:** Capture donor details, donation history, preferences.  
- **Campaign Object:** Fundraising goals, target amount, duration, progress tracking.  
- **Beneficiary Object:** Individuals/communities supported by donations.  
- **Donation Object:** Links Donor → Campaign → Beneficiary.  
- **Automation:** Email/SMS thank-you notes, reminders for recurring donors.  
- **Reports:** Campaign progress, donor engagement trends, beneficiary impact.  

### Non-Functional Requirements  
- Mobile-friendly via Salesforce Mobile App for field workers.  
- Role-based access (Donor vs NGO Staff vs Admin).  
- Secure handling of donor data and financial records.  
- Scalable for thousands of donors and campaigns.

##  Stakeholder Analysis  

| Stakeholder   | Needs / Responsibilities |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| Donors        | Donate easily, receive acknowledgments, view transparency dashboard showing fund usage. |
| NGO Staff     | Create/manage campaigns, track donations, allocate funds to beneficiaries, send updates. |
| Beneficiaries | Receive funds/support, linked to donor campaigns, provide success stories. |
| Admin         | Setup org, users, profiles, permissions, ensure compliance and security. |

##  Business Process Mapping  

### Current Manual Process  
- Donations tracked in Excel with limited visibility.  
- Donors manually informed via email/WhatsApp after contributions.  
- Campaign progress updated monthly → delays in transparency.  
- Impact reports created manually, often inaccurate or delayed.  

### Proposed Salesforce Process  
1. Donor registers → donation captured in Salesforce.  
2. Donation linked automatically to a campaign and mapped to beneficiaries.  
3. Auto-generated thank-you email & receipt sent instantly.  
4. Flow sends reminder for recurring donations.  
5. NGO staff update beneficiary progress (photos, stories, fund usage).  
6. Donors log in to Donor Portal (LWC) → view how their funds are used.  
7. Dashboards auto-refresh → showing live campaign progress and donor engagement.
